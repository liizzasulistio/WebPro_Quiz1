            <h2><u>How I Create this Website?</u></h2>
            <h4>Saturday, 10 October 2020</h4>
            <p>Actually, I don't know what should I put on the homepage as it isn't stated on the questions.
                I was gonna write "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet blablabla" but I think if it's better to write how I create this website.
                So, let's get started!
            </p>
            <p>
                I've always love making something that related to art, I'm just that ordinary girl who does drawing, painting, creating comic, 
                or even short animation on her free time. Then I chose Informatics Engineering Department as my major on college. So that's why I
                have to learn how to code and one of them is making this <b>static website</b>. What if.. I try to apply both my so-ordinary-design-skill
                 and my coding skill to finish this assignment? I used to do blogging since I was in Junior High School (around 2013) and I'm quite 
                 familiar with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
            </p>
            <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                <li>First, I design the mockup of the website using <i>Framer</i>, it's an online tools to create a prototype</li>
                <li>Then, I tried to turn this simple design to codes using <i>Visual Studio Code</i>.</li>
                <li>Of course I still had to face some trouble, that's why I need to go back and forth within my browser and the text editor.</li>
            </ul>
