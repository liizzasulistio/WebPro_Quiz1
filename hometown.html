            <p>Hello everyone!
            </p>
            <p>The picture above is Suro and Boyo, the Surabaya name origin. Altough I was dilemma to chose between Bangkalan (Madura) and Surabaya, 
                I decided to talk about Surabaya since it's the place I currently live in.
            </p>
            <p>Surabaya is the capital city of East Java which is located on the nothern coast of the province. Alongside with Gresik, Bangkalan, Mojokerto, 
                Sidoarjo, and Lamongan, Surabaya is the main core of a metropolitan area which also known as Gerbangkertosusila (was taken from the related 
                cities name). As a metropolitan city, Surabaya is almost active for 24/7. Surabaya is also known as Kota Pahlawan (tr: City of Heroes), it's 
                named by the most historical event which happened to be in Surabaya - The Battle of Surabaya. This event took place because <i>Arek-Arek Suroboyo</i> 
                refused to surrender and fought the British troops. One of the iconic part of this event is when the Indonesian revolutionaries tore of the blue 
                part of the Dutch flag which was hoisted above Yamato Hotel (now Majapahi Hotel) so it became Indonesia's flag "Merah Putih".
            </p>
            <p>I think that's all what I can deliver to you all, and yes I love my hometown.</p>
