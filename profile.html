            <h2><u>My Profile</u></h2>
            <h4>Saturday, 10 October 2020</h4>
            <p>Hello everyone!</p>
            <p>I'm Lii'zza Aisyah Putri Sulistio, I have a lot of nicknames and I won't mention them one by one because it'd be a long long list. 
                My friends often call me Lisa or Shasa, and also Ms. Sulistio if it's on formal occasions. But if we're close enough, they would 
                call me by Hun/Ai (which means love in Japanese and an abbreviation from my middle name-Aisyah). I was born in Surabaya 20 years ago 
                and become the first child and the first grandchildren in my family. Being the oldest child is not easy, because I have to take part 
                in taking care my sisters, "I need to be <b>perfect</b> in every aspects so they can see me as a role-model" they said. Well, I know 
                that we don't have to be perfect because nobody is perfect. But the fact is I still have that perfectionist trait, it might be my strength 
                and also be my weakness (eg. finishing a perfect task or not finish it if it's not perfect because I tend to focus on small details).
            </p>
            <p>As you may see on the sidebar, I currently study at ITS as Informatics Engineering student. Furthermore, I have a lot of hobbies 
                or maybe you can call it as routines as I do it regularly and I have a lot of interest in many fields. Here's the list below:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Languages</li>
                <p>I always have interest in languages since I was kid. I don't know why, maybe it's because I used to be around people that speak different 
                     languages (Maduranese, Javanese, Sundanese, and a little bit Banjarese), my big family come from different ethnics, just like Indonesian motto 
                     "Bhinneka Tunggal Ika". Okay back to topic, I learnt English as my n<sup>th</sup> language when I was in kindergarten. Due to the influence of 
                     Anime/Manga and Kpop Wave in Indonesia, I started to think "Why don't I learn their languages? It'd be great if I can enjoy the entertainments 
                     without waiting for the translation to be released."
                </p>
                <p>
                    I started to learn Japanese during the Junior High School graduation holiday, then I joined Japanese Club (SAKURA) when I became a High School student. 
                    Now, I take part at Japanese Division from IFLS (ITS Foreign Languages Society) as a teacher.
                </p>
                <li>Arts</li>
                <p>My family is always related to any forms of art, whether it's traditional arts (Indonesian traditional dance) or modern arts. But, only music and 
                    painting that caught my heart succesfully. I learnt how to play the piano since 2005 and took some examinations to measure my ability. I also learnt 
                    how to play violin because my great-grandfather is a violinist and learnt how to play guitar because my <i>papa</i> and <i>mami</i> (I call my 
                    grandfather papa and grandmother mami) gave a guitar as gift because I got a good grades. Moreover, my papa can play a guitar, that's why I asked 
                    him how to play. I also joined school band and made one with my friends who has the same interest in both music and Japan. 
                    But, I stopped to focus on them as I became a 12<sub>th</sub> grade student and focus on SBMPTN (an university entrance examinations).
                </p>
                <li>Sports</li>
                <p>At first, I'm not into sports even though I'm good at physical activities. The first sport that became my favourite is running. As I grow up, I 
                    was diagnosed with scoliosis and my doctor advise me to swim regularly. Of course I denied it since I'm afraid to water (in big forms, such as sea, 
                    pool, and pond). But then my mother found a good teacher that made me believe that water is not that scary. I started to spend money with swim accesories, 
                    I even bought minus googles (as I'm a shortsigted and have astigmatism eyes) so that I can see everything clearly while swimming.
                </p>
                <p>Another sport I like is cycling and archery. I go to my Junior High School with bycycle since it only takes 5 minutes from my house, and during the 
                    first year in university I also use a bycycle as my main mobility because I live at a flat (<i>kos kosan</i>) for awhile. These days, I'm kind of 
                    miss to do those activities outside. Due to the pandemic situation, the only sport I can do at home is running on a treadmill, archery on my home yard 
                    and do some workout that don't need much time and equipment.
                </p>
