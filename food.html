               <p>Semanggi or also known as Pecel Semanggi is one local food of Surabaya. It consists of steamed Semanggi or clover leaves as the main 
                   ingredient is served alongside with been sprouts, kale leaves, kerupuk puli (which made from rice), and sweet potatoes sauce. It's always
                   served on pincuk or a simple plate from banana leaves. Sometimes people add sambal (traditional chili sauce) to make it spicy. The Semanggi 
                   sellers often go around the neighbourhood and with the iconic pitch "Semanggi... Nggi... Semanggi...", ah it's sad that I can't attach a mp3 here.

           <div id="column2">
               <p>Tahu Tek was taken from tahu (tofu) as the main ingredient of this dish and "tek", many people said that this term was taken due to the sound made 
                   by the Tahu Tek seller when the cut the tofu with scissors. Tahu tek is served with tahu (tofu), potatoes, scrambled egg (optional), lontong 
                   (steamed rice with banana leaves as its cover), bean sprouts, cucumber, peanut sauce with petis (a local sauce which made from ebi/shrimp/fish/any seafood) 
                   and sweet soy sauce, fried onions, and kerupuk. This kerupuk is different from the kerupuk we use on Semanggi, this kind of kerupuk was made of shrimp or fish.

           <div id="column2">
               <p>Lontong Balap is also taken from its main ingredient-Lontong, a steamed rice with banana leaves as its cover. This dish consists of lontong, tofu, bean 
                   sprouts, lentho (another local snack that made from cowpeas), fried onions, sweet soy sauce, sambal, and soup. Lontong Balap is often served with 
                   sate kerang (clamp satay) as the side dish.
               </p>
               <p>A long time ago, Lontong Balap was made inside big pottery and the seller would carry them around the city. In order to get more buyers the Lontong Balap 
                   sellers walk fast and compete to each others to get the strategic place to sell Lontong Balap. Due to the heavy pottery they must carry,
                    this situation can be seen as running competition between the sellers. The origin of Lontong Balap name was taken from this situation, <i>balap</i> means racing.

               <p>Rawon is a black meat soup which categorized as main dishes. The black color of its soup is because of the usage of kluwek or kepayang alongside with other 
                   spices. Rawon is often served with rice and some toppings such as sambal, bean sprouts, lime, salted egg, and of course kerupuk.
